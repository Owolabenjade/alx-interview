# Prime Game

This project involves a game where two players (Maria and Ben) take turns removing prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers starting from 1. The player who cannot make a move loses the game.

## Requirements

The solution uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to identify prime numbers, game theory concepts, and optimal strategies for playing the game.

## Running the Code

Run the Python script with the following command:

```bash
./0-prime_game.py
